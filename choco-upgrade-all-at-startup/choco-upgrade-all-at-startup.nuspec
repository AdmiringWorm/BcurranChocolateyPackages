# DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES EVERY TIME YOUR COMPUTER BOOTS? 

# YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!
	
### This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run "choco upgrade all -y" with enhanced options every time your computer boots.

Please understand your computer boot time will increase. If you reboot daily, you'll probably never notice. If you reboot infrequently, you'll notice a slow down as packages are downloaded and updated/installed, especially if you have a slow Internet connection. Because of this **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** is pseudo-deprecated and pseudo-superseded by **[choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** which allows you to set a time to run "choco upgrade all -y" every day in the wee hours of morning while you're happily dreaming of owning a supercomputer instead of twiddling your thumbs waiting for your "slow" computer to boot up. Otherwise it works wonderfully at keeping your Chocolatey installed programs up to date.

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
* You can do nothing and it will run at startup when on AC power.
* You can manually run **choco-upgrade-all** from Command Prompt or PowerShell.
* You can click the Upgrade All Packages icon in the Chocolatey Start Menu groun if you have [choco-shortcuts-winconfig](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig) installed.
* You can manually run **choco-install packagename** from Command Prompt or PowerShell to install packages with your **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** settings.

### CONFIGURATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Run **choco-upgrade-all -EditConfig** to enable enhanced options such as:
* automatically delete newly installed Desktop and Start Menu icons
* run pre and/or post processing scripts
* setting a default user profile

SYSADMINS: I recommend use of **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** for notebook/laptop users who tend to shut down their computers at night and thus miss scheduled updates/maintenance such as **[choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** (in the wee hours of the morning).

#### IF UPGRADING FROM A VERSION EARLIER THAN 2021.03.15:
It is **HIGHLY** advised you read the Release Notes/ChangeLog and **run choco-upgrade-all -EditConfig** to enable the new enhanced features.

**[PACKAGE NOTES](https://github.com/bcurran3/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup/readme.md)**

Added -EditConfig option to edit the config file.
* 2018.08.22 - Fixed compatibility with Windows 7 and 8 machines by using SchTasks.exe for everything and not using the Windows 10/Server 2016 only get-scheduledtask cmdlet. Removed PowerShell v4/v5 dependency.

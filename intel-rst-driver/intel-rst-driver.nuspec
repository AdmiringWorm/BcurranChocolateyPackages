### Detailed Description

Note: Intel recommends that end users utilize driver updates provided by their system manufacturer/provider or via Windows* Update to eliminate the potential impact caused by loading non-customized drivers. System manufacturers regularly customize Intel generic drivers to meet the needs of their specific system design. In such cases, use of the Intel generic driver update is not recommended.

### Purpose
	
The Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) Driver 18.1.6.1039 supports the configuration and enabling of multiple features including:

* System acceleration with Intel® Optane™ memory
* Configuration and maintenance of RAID 0/1/5/10
* Intel® VMD support on 11th Gen platforms (See more details here)

To manage these capabilities, download the Intel® Optane™ Memory and Storage Management application found on the Microsoft Store.

This package is a pseudo replacement for [choco-upgrade-all-at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at) which is a pseudo replacement for [choco-upgrade-all-at-startup](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup). (Got that? There will be a pop quiz!) **CCU** is a result of my obsessive desire to keep my Chocolatey packages up-to-date.

# DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY?

# YOU JUST FOUND THE EASIEST WAY!
	
# HOW DOES IT WORK?

**CCU** starts a background PowerShell process which continuously checks [FeedBurner](https://feeds.feedburner.com/chocolatey) for recently published Chocolatey packages. When locally installed packages are found in the feed, they are automatically upgraded.

**CCU** defaults to checking every 30 minutes, automatically upgrading packages, and no foreground notifications. These defaults are overridable and configurable; e.g. you could use **CCU** to just notify you of upgrades without automatically installing them.

### HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:
Install my [choco-toast-notifications.hook](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-toast-notifications.hook) to enable beautiful foreground toast notifications of package installs, upgrades, and uninstalls. If you plan to use **CCU** only for notifications of upgrades without having them automatically installed, I recommend using [burnttoast-psmodule](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/burnttoast-psmodule) for those notifications.

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
**CCU -Start** will start **CCU** with defaults.
**CCU -Status** will display **CCU**'s running options and packages that have been upgraded or waiting to be upgraded.
**CCU -Notify** (assumes -Start) will send foreground notifications of upgrades using either BurntToast or MSG.
**CCU -NoUpgrades** (assumes -Start) will check for upgrades but not automatically install them.
**CCU -Stop** to stop **CCU**.
**CCU -EditConfig** to set your custom defaults.
**CCU -Help** for more info.

CodeTwo Active Directory Photos is a free desktop application that lets you upload photographs to Active Directory and manage them easily by using a light and super-intuitive user interface. The photos can be visible in Outlook emails, contacts and GALs, as well as in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA), SharePoint, Skype for Business and Lync. The program has been designed to make the management of dozens of users' images quite straightforward and ultra-fast. Setting up thousands of Active Directory users' photographs is just a matter of cooking soft boiled eggs, which really makes this program stand out in the crowd.
